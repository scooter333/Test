This is a file of Scott's Musings

I am often confused about the meaning of life.  Where am I.

What is my purpose?  

These are the questions that drive me, Scoooter "Scott" Renshaw to live my life.

I find that my purose is often a controversial topic since I ocassionally deem my purpose to be all for not.

People often ask me where I am from. Where aren't I from. Miami runs through us all.
